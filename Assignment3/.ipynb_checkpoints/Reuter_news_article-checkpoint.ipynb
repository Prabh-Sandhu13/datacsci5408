nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.\\n    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,\\nordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to\\nforce prices up and end the dumping.\\n    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science\\nBoard task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new\\nelectronic products and manufacturing processes and make the\\nU.S. industory more competitive.\\n    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to\\npass and that action was required now to help the depressed\\nelectronic industry.\\n    Bywater said, \"I urge the Reagan Administration to take full\\nand severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the\\nretaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT\\n(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).\"\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"NO\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14537\" NEWID=\"9016\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 16:12:10.73</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2454&#31;reute\\nu f BC-EXXON-(XON)-GETS-99.2   03-24 0030</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>EXXON (XON) GETS 99.2 MLN DLR CONTRACT</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Co USA of Houston has been\\nawarded a 99.2 mln dlr contract for jet fuel, the Defense\\nLogistics Agency said.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"NO\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14538\" NEWID=\"9017\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 16:12:45.97</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2456&#31;reute\\nu f BC-EATON-(ETN)-GETS-53.0   03-24 0035</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>EATON (ETN) GETS 53.0 MLN DLR CONTRACT</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eaton Corp\\'s AIL Division has\\nreceived a 53.0 mln dlr contract for jamming system work for\\nthe EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft, the Navy said.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14539\" NEWID=\"9018\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 16:12:53.77</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>grain</D><D>rice</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D><D>zaire</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;C G\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2457&#31;reute\\nu f BC-ZAIRE-AUTHORIZED-TO-B   03-24 0077</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>ZAIRE AUTHORIZED TO BUY PL 480 RICE - USDA</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zaire has been authorized to\\npurchase about 30,000 tonnes of U.S. rice under an existing PL\\n480 agreement, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.\\n    It may buy the rice, valued at 5.5 mln dlrs, between March\\n31 and August 31, 1987, and ship it from U.S. ports by\\nSeptember 30, the department said.\\n    The purchase authorization covers the entire quantity of\\nrice provided under the agreement.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"NO\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14540\" NEWID=\"9019\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 16:13:26.14</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2459&#31;reute\\nu f BC-MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS-GET   03-24 0036</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>MCDONNELL DOUGLAS GETS 30.6 MLN DLR CONTRACT</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>McDonnell Douglas Corp (MD) has\\nreceived a 30.6 mln dlr contract for work on development of the\\nstandoff land attack missile (SLAM), the Navy said.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14541\" NEWID=\"9020\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 16:15:17.01</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>acq</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2463&#31;reute\\nr f BC-MIDIVEST-ACQUIRES-ASS   03-24 0080</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>MIDIVEST ACQUIRES ASSETS OF BUSINESS AVIATION</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    ROANOKE, Va., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Midivest Inc> said it acquired\\nall the assets of &lt;Business Aviation Inc> of Sioux Falls, S.D.,\\nfor an undisclosed amount of stock.\\n    Midivest said it expects to sell 10 to 20 of the renovated\\nBeechcraft planes next year.

And\\neconomic fundamentals will always come to the fore,\" said a\\ndealer at one major U.S. bank.\\n    As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the\\nyen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,\\nFederal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the\\nmarkets on behalf of the U.S. currency.\\n    Reports of the authorities\\' actions helped the dollar\\nrecover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from\\nthe post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still\\nfailed to regain Monday\\'s U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.\\n    Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5\\nbillion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars\\nyesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.\\n    Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the\\nFed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen\\ntoday. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased\\na small amount of dollars for yen.\\n    The Fed\\'s last confirmed intervention was on January 28\\nwhen it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of\\nJapan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have\\nsignalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.\\n    The authorities\\' actions appeared to back up the February\\n22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,\\nFrance and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate\\nto foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.\\n    But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by\\nthe authorities\\' intervention which they said can only soften\\nextreme moves in the market.\\n    For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed\\'s\\npurchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than\\nfor the U.S. central bank\\'s own account, suggesting a rather  \\nwatered-down American commitment to the currency accord.\\n    The Bank of England\\'s action also was thought to be\\ncompleted on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing\\nthe market\\'s view that Japan is the most resolute of the six\\nnations in its support of the currency pact.\\n    \"No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other\\ntwo central banks seem to be making more token gestures than\\nanything else,\" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.\\n    \"I\\'m not convinced the intervention was concerted,\" said\\nEarl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. \\n\"It\\'s a yen problem more than anything else.\"\\n    Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist\\nsentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American\\nauthorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.\\n    \"The dollar\\'s break below the key 150 yen level ties the\\nTreasury\\'s hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on\\nits own account because of the strength of protectionism here,\"\\nsaid Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.\\n    Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets\\nare becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official\\ndenials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a\\nlower dollar to help trim the nation\\'s trade deficit.\\n    The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade\\ndeficit in 1986 was with Japan.\\n    Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker\\'s comment on\\nSunday that the February currency pact had not established\\ndollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the\\nU.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.\\n    \"The dollar still has more room on the downside against the\\nyen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The\\ncurrency market is becoming very political,\" said Natsuo Okada\\nof Sumitomo Bank Ltd.\\n    Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen\\nthis week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end\\nof April or early May.\\n    Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their\\neconomies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic\\nimbalances in the near future, dealers said.\\n    \"Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it\\nwon\\'t be enough to help the trade situation much,\" said\\nBourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to\\n148 yen in the next couple of days.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14544\" NEWID=\"9023\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 16:17:58.20</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;RM V\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2475&#31;reute\\nu f BC-/U.S.-TO-SELL-12.8-BI   03-24 0066</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>U.S. TO SELL 12.8 BILLION DLRS IN BILLS</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury said it will sell\\n12.8 billion dlrs of three and six-month bills at its regular\\nauction next week.\\n    The March 30 sale, to be evenly divided between the three\\nand six month issues, will result in a paydown of 1.2 billion\\ndlrs as maturing bills total 13.99 billion dlrs.\\n    The bills will be issued April 2.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"NO\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14545\" NEWID=\"9024\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 16:22:32.09</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2482&#31;reute\\nr f BC-INLAND-STEEL-&lt;IAD>-TO   03-24 0081</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>INLAND STEEL &lt;IAD> TO BUILD NEW PLANT IN INDIANA</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    SOUTH BEND, Ind., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Inland Steel Industries and\\nGovernor Robert Orr of Indiana said the new joint venture cold-\\nrolled steel plant between Inland Steel and Nippon Steel Corp\\nwill be built on a site in St. Joseph County Indiana.\\n    Inland Steel said yesterday that the joint venture, to be\\nnamed I/N Tek, will cost more than 400 mln dlrs and will employ\\nover 200 people by the time the companies complete the project\\nin 1990.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14546\" NEWID=\"9025\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 16:22:41.79</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>acq</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2483&#31;reute\\nb f BC-******EASTMAN-KODAK-C   03-24 0093</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>EASTMAN KODAK &lt;EK> TO SELL HOLDINGS</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co said it plans\\nto sell its 2.3 pct holding in ICN Pharmaceuticals &lt;ICN> and\\npart of its nine pct holdings in Viratek &lt;VIRA>.\\n    It said the purpose of the investments had been to lay the\\ngroundwork for the creation of its Nucleic Acid Research\\nInstitute.\\n    Since that has been achieved, there is no longer any reason\\nto maintain the equity positions, Kodak said.\\n    Kodak holds 470,000 sahres of ICN, currently trading at\\nabout 18-3/4 and 700,000 of Viratek, trading at 44.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"NO\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14547\" NEWID=\"9026\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 16:23:12.76</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE><D>boesky</D></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2485&#31;reute\\nu f BC-GUINNESS   03-24 0094</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>GUINNESS SUES BOESKY IN FEDERAL COURT</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Guinness PLC> has joined investors\\nsuing former Wall Street speculator Ivan Boesky, alleging it\\nwas deceived into putting money into his one billion dlr\\ninvestment partnership in 1986.\\n    Guinness, the largest limited partner in Ivan F.

A\\nsevere drought that summer in major producing states caused\\nyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2\\nbillion bushels.\\n    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts\\nsaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion\\nbushels, down from last year\\'s crop of 8.3 billion bushels.\\n    \"This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant\\nreduction in production,\" an analyst said.\\n    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.\\ncorn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not\\nincrease significantly, a specialist said.\\n    High producing corn belt states are expected to show the\\ngreatest acreage reductions, based upon historical\\nparticipation in government programs, analysts said.\\n    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most\\nin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western\\ncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.\\n    \"Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,\"\\nhe said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in\\nhigher-producing delta areas.\\n    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year\\'s\\n2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.\\n    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in\\n1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has\\nsteadily declined in the 1980\\'s.\\n    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in\\nthe low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The\\nhighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has\\nkept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln\\nacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.\\n    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields\\naveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.\\n    \"We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion\\nbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,\" an analyst said.\\n    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as\\nlong as government program provisions remain the same, analysts\\nsaid.\\n    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to\\nset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible\\nfor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15\\npct of their acreage.\\n    \"To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to\\nprovide more incentives,\" an analyst said.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14580\" NEWID=\"9059\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 17:10:32.59</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>acq</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2620&#31;reute\\nr f BC-KIRSCHNER-&lt;KMDC>-COMP   03-24 0065</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>KIRSCHNER &lt;KMDC> COMPLETES PURCHASE</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    TIMONIUM, Md., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kirschner Medical corp said it\\ncompleted the acquisition of Minnesota Mining and\\nManufacturing\\'s &lt;MMM> orthopedic metal implant line division.\\n    The acquisition price is 12.0 mln dlrs in cash, a six mln\\ndlr three year note and 100,000 shares of Kirschner common\\nstock.\\n    The division had sales of 11.3 mln dlrs in 1986.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14581\" NEWID=\"9060\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 17:10:45.15</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>trade</D><D>hog</D><D>carcass</D><D>livestock</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D><D>ussr</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;C G L\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2621&#31;reute\\nr f BC-U.S.-SENATORS-SEEK-TO   03-24 0126</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>U.S. SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading U.S. farm state senators are\\nseeking to insert into the Senate\\'s omnibus trade bill a\\nprovision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the\\nU.S. Agriculture Department\\'s export enhancement program, EEP,\\nto include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including\\nthe Soviet Union, Senate staff said.\\n    Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to\\nrecoup export markets lost to competing nations\\' unfair trading\\npractices.\\n    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)\\nis leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to\\nbroaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be\\neligible for the subsidies, sources said.\\n    The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman\\nLloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor\\n(D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) --\\nalso may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork\\nproducers and processors from Canadian imports.\\n    The measure, sponsored by Sen.

</DATELINE><BODY>Automobile dealerships have become\\nlarge, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1\\nbillion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.\\n    Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and\\nbuyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the\\nlargest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts\\nsay.\\n    Retail car sales \"are at a point of transition. There\\'s not\\nmuch that\\'s off the table in terms of creative thinking\" about\\nways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University\\nof Michigan\\'s Transportation Research Institute.\\n    The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than it\\nwas in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit\\nanalyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.\\n    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.\\nDealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or a\\nStudebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold\\n738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National\\nAutomobile Dealers Association.\\n    That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany\\'s Volkswagen\\nBeatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"a\\nrebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from\\nrestrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,\\nsays Jauppi.\\n    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has\\nbeen in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,\\nthe average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold\\nincrease from 1956--and employed 34 workers.\\n    \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln\\ndlrs a year and didn\\'t know what to do with all his money,\"\\nsays Cole.\\n    \"There\\'s a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that\\nmake cars,\" he says.\\n    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying\\nup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend\\nwill let up.\\n    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.\\nPower, a California-based market research firm, says that, by\\n1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800\\nprincipal owners today.\\n    Many dealers are experimenting with owning several\\nfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It\\nused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a\\nChevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says.\\n    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about\\nthe possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned\\nor open international operations.\\n    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,\\n\"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole.\\n    Although some say the franchise system might get in the way\\nof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to\\ntrading in car dealer shares.\\n    \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing\\nthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those\\ncars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says.\\n    \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the\\nscale some of these dealers, it\\'s going to be very hard to\\nresist taking them public,\" said another analyst.\\n    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become\\ninternational.\\n    \"We\\'re going to have international dealers--dealer networks\\nthat are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted\\nparticularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster\\nthan the U.S., he says.\\n    \"It\\'s not totally off the wall,\" says Cole.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14632\" NEWID=\"9111\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 19:05:22.61</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>earn</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2824&#31;reute\\nr f BC-COMPREHENSIVE-CARE-CO   03-24 0046</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>COMPREHENSIVE CARE CORP &lt;CMPH> 3RD QTR NET</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    IRVINE, Calif., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Qtr ended Feb 28\\n    Shr 17 cts vs 22 cts\\n    Net 2,041,000 vs 3,329,000\\n    Revs 46.6 mln vs 48.9 mln\\n    Nine mths\\n    Shr 65 cts vs 82 cts\\n    Net 9,290,000 vs 12.7 mln\\n    Revs 142.7 mln vs 139.8 mln\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14633\" NEWID=\"9112\">\\n<DATE>24-MAR-1987 19:07:46.04</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>earn</D><D>acq</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F Y\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2826&#31;reute\\nr f BC-CHAPMAN-&lt;CHPN>-IN-RES   03-24 0067</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>CHAPMAN &lt;CHPN> IN RESTRUCTURING</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    DALLAS, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chapman Energy INc said it is launching\\na major restructuring which, if not approved, it will have no\\nalternative but to seek protection under Chapter 11.\\n    Under the plan, Chapman will exchange securities and cash\\nfor all outstanding 12 pct senior subordinated debentures due\\n2000 and will sell a controlling interest to Troon Partners\\nLtd.\\n   The agreement with Troon requires Troon to advance 6.5 mln\\ndlrs partially secured by a first mortgage lien on the\\ncompany\\'s interest in its natural gas pipeline partnership and\\nTroon to tender 100,000 principal amount of debentures to\\nChapman.\\n    Proceeds of the loan will be used for the cash portion of\\nthe restructuring.

But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based\\nbanks are boosting their treasury operations in London.\\n    As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade\\nfinance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain\\nran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.\\nClearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.\\n    The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab\\nBanking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased\\ntheir presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading\\nrepresentative offices to branch status to allow dealing.\\n    One economist said: \"It is cheaper to run a riyal book in\\nLondon than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...\\nThere is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.\"\\n    Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit\\ntaker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,\\n&lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November\\n1986.\\n    The major market maker has traditionally been London-based\\nconsortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom\\njoint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its\\nLondon operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.\\n    One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: \"Inevitably the\\nvolume of business in London has gained pace with the two new\\nlicences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most\\nof the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.\"\\n    Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi\\nriyal market is difficult to quantify.\\n    Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency\\ndeposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped\\nto the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986\\nfrom 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.\\n    The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal\\ntrading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very\\nquiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now\\nstaff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect\\n&lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.\\n    Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market\\nmoving completely out of the region, partly because of local\\ndemand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian\\nMonetary Agency\\'s (SAMA) desire to moderate\\ninternationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue\\nspeculation.\\n    There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market\\nshifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain\\nand London is still limited.\\n    But for the first time since the formation of the six\\nnation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs\\nthat a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.\\n    Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final\\ncurrency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,\\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\\n    But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary\\nSystem style with a common peg have been discussed at high\\nlevel and could be a topic on the GCC\\'s annual summit expected\\nto be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.\\n    One dealer said: \"A lot of exposure is being given to\\ndiscussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the\\nend a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\"\\n    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.\\n    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated\\nsince the start of the GCC.

(and\\nissue) excessive wage and bonus increases,\" he said.\\n    Failure to cut this excess will \"result in reduced\\naccumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality,\"\\nZhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low per\\ncapita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.\\n    China needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction\\nin its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption\\nmust match the available resources, he said.\\n    Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986\\nbecause of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising cost\\nof foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced income\\nfrom customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.\\n    Local authorities, departments and firms have been able to\\nretain more revenue since economic reforms in 1979. \"(They)\\nunjustifiably developed processing industries and\\nnon-productive construction,\" Zhao said.\\n    He said that unless effective measures are taken to curb\\nthis practice, financial and credit deficits are likely to\\nincrease in the next few years.\\n    Zhao said that if such deficits become excessive and last\\ntoo long, they will cause the over-issue of money, which in\\nturn will cause \"disturbing inflation, a precipitous rise in\\ncommodity prices and chaos in economic life.\"\\n    Another serious problem is that too many new construction\\nprojects have been launched. Fixed asset investment outside the\\nstate plan is over-extended and the pattern of such investment\\nis highly irrational, he said.\\n    Investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw\\nand semi-finished materials industries is inadequate and\\ninvestment in non-productive projects is too large, he said.\\n     Zhao said some departments and local authorities have\\nfailed to take prompt and effective measures to correct this\\ninvestment imbalance, despite instructions to do so from the\\nState Council earlier this year.\\n     He said China\\'s per capita output of grain and other farm\\nand sideline products is still very low and production of\\ngrain, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries rests on a\\nrather weak foundation.\\n     China\\'s countryside is still in the development stage and\\nthere is vast potential to be tapped through deep reforms, he\\nsaid, but did not elaborate.\\n    Zhao said the main task for reform in 1987 is to breathe\\nlife into China\\'s large and medium sized state firms, which\\nstill do not have \"a satisfactory combination of\\nresponsibilities, powers and benefits.\"\\n    \"We have yet to create conditions for giving the enterprises\\nfull managerial authority and full responsibility for their own\\nprofits and losses,\" he said.\\n    Currently, the firms are not responding rationally to\\nmarket changes and doing all the state requires of them, he\\nsaid. Their potential is not being fully tapped, he added.\\n    Zhao said that in 1987, China will speed up the reform of\\nits financial system, diversify credit services, encourage\\ncompetition among different financial institutions and promote\\ninsurance services.\\n    He said the system of bank interest rates must be reformed,\\nwith differential and floating rates being applied for\\ndifferent periods of time.\\n    China must, under proper guidance, develop markets for the\\ncirculation of funds in major cities and exploit the role of\\nfinancial markets in pooling and regulating funds, he added.\\n    Zhao said China must also expand the market for capital\\ngoods such as rolled steel, coal, cement and timber. The lack\\nof such a market is the main reason why large state firms have\\n\"yet to be fully invigorated,\" he said.\\n    He also promised a continuation of the labour contract\\nsystem under which all firms hire workers for a fixed period\\nand pay them according to their own methods, subject only to\\nstate-set ceilings for wages and bonuses.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14702\" NEWID=\"9181\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 05:24:23.31</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>earn</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>japan</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F M C\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0318&#31;reute\\nu f BC-NIPPON-STEEL-TO-REDUC   03-25 0086</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>NIPPON STEEL TO REDUCE DIVIDEND</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nippon Steel Corp &lt;NSTC.T> plans to\\nreduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 31\\n1987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said.\\n    The company estimated parent company current losses at 15\\nbillion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from\\nthe sale of securities.

Headquarters in\\nNew York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter\\ninto force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting\\nfor 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.\\n    Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said\\nthe formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of\\nliquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber\\nand a possible depression of prices.\\n    He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to\\nkeep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose\\nor fell through its buffer stock system.\\n    Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of\\npurchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a\\ncontingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done\\nthrough direct cash contributions from members, he said.\\n    Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to\\nfinance INRA\\'s buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed\\nwith concern by some members who fear the INRA may become\\nindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International\\nTin Agreement.\\n    \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out\\nwithout any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said.\\n     Malaysia, the world\\'s largest producer, was seeking\\ncabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers\\nand consumers would also become members, he said.\\n    Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit\\nto Indonesia\\'s rubber industry\\'s by stabilising prices.\\n    It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because\\nits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.\\n    Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new\\npact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt\\nthe INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market\\noperations.\\n     Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free\\nrubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at\\nlevels that were only acceptable to consumers.\\n    \"With the INRA\\'s ability to keep prices at a certain stable\\nlevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,\\nwhile producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a Malaysian\\nRubber Producers Council source told Reuters.\\n    Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the\\noverhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had\\npsychologically prevented price rises, he said.\\n    State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had\\nbeen depressed since INRA\\'s inception and the creation of a\\nbuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.\\n    Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was\\nexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.\\n    Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be\\npressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to\\nstabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers\\nto produce more.\\n    Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact\\'s\\nconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to\\nallow sharp price fluctuations in future.\\n    \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be\\nliquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said.\\n    Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success\\nas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they\\nquestioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers\\nto finance buffer stock operations.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14725\" NEWID=\"9204\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 06:52:09.01</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>pet-chem</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>switzerland</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0442&#31;reute\\nu f BC-CIBA-GEIGY,-PHILLIPS   03-25 0116</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>CIBA-GEIGY, PHILLIPS PETROLEUM IN JOINT VENTURE</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    BASLE, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ciba-Geigy AG &lt;CIGZ.Z> said it would\\nestablish a joint venture with Phillips Petroleum Co.

</DATELINE><BODY>London\\'s rise as a trading centre for\\nU.S. Government debt has been spurred by the increasing use of\\ninterest rate swaps, which are now arranged for most new issues\\nin the eurobond markets, traders and analysts said.\\n    Indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all\\nnew debt issued here last year -- over 186 billion dlrs worth\\n-- was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.\\n    \"The U.S. Treasuries market here is swap-driven,\" said David\\nJones, vice president at Goldman Sachs and Co international and\\nhead of its U.S. Government bond trading desk.\\n    \"It is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in\\n10-years, seven years or five years, all related to an interest\\nrate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal,\" Jones said at a recent\\nconference on the U.S. Treasuries market.\\n    Just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size going\\nthrough brokers screens in London were unthinkable.\\n    Traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading in\\nU.S. Treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over the\\ndirection of interest rates, swap-related deals have provided\\nthe sole source of new business.\\n    Dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involving\\ntwo and 10-year Treasuries was transacted on brokers\\' screens.\\n    The trade, they said, was swap related.\\n    There are no firm figures on exactly how much U.S. Treasury\\ndebt is traded here and estimates vary widely.\\n    But Wrightson Economics, a U.S.-based research firm which\\ndrew its data from U.S. Treasury reports, estimated that gross\\ntransactions in U.S. Government securities in London rose to\\n341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone,\\nagainst 188 billion in all of 1985.\\n    Wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all U.S. Treasury\\ntrading is transacted outside the U.S., With Tokyo forming the\\nthird major centre.\\n    And while figures are not yet available for the last\\nquarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend\\ncontinued, traders say.\\n    Richard Lacy, chief executive at Exco International, put\\naverage daily Treasuries trading volume in London at about 15\\nbillion dlrs. Exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJ\\nSecurities inc, one of the four major brokers in U.S.\\nGovernment bonds which has offices in London, New York and\\nTokyo.\\n    But Dick Van Splinter, president of RMJ\\'s competitor,\\nFundamental Brokers Inc\\'s London operations, estimates average\\ndaily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.\\n    But even at the low range of estimates, Treasuries trading\\nvolume is at least equal to that in the U.K.\\'s own government\\nbonds, known as gilts.\\n     Jeremy Ford, vice president at Bankers Trust International\\nLtd, explained that U.S. Treasuries are used by intermediaries\\nin swap transactions to lock in the \"spread,\" the difference\\nbetween the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the rate\\nthat the counterparty is obliged to pay.\\n    But even beyond swap-related activity, dealers said the\\nnature of trading in London has changed.\\n    \"The interesting thing our figures show is the transition in\\nLondon from a marketing effort to a trading effort,\" said Louis\\nCrandall, an economist at Wrightson who has been collecting the\\ndata.\\n    Crandall said that previously, firms\\' activities were\\nlimited to trying to sell U.S. Securities to European\\ninvestors.

</DATELINE><BODY>The chances of U.K. Stocks continuing\\nrecent rises as budget euphoria gives way to the uncertainties\\nof a probable election are small, and market analysts say there\\nwill probably be a downwards correction in the next few weeks.\\n    The U.K. Market has managed a dizzy rise since the New\\nYear, with the FT-SE index of 100 leading shares lifting 22.5\\npct since January 2 to current levels around 2050.\\n    \"Over the next month or two the odds are that the index will\\ndrop back to around 1,900,\" said John Goldschmidt, head of\\nequities research at Chase Manhattan Securities.\\n    \"A five to 10 pct drop is likely. There was a six pct fall\\nbefore the 1983 election when the Conservatives were further\\nahead in the polls and the market was on a multiple of only 14\\ninstead of 18 now,\" noted Nick Knight of brokers James Capel.\\n    \"The old adage is \"sell in May and go away\\'.

It was estimated that if\\noil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that\\ncould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.\\n    - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It\\nwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000\\nbarrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.\\n    - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical\\nexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a\\nday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.\\n    - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to\\nspur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for\\nthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower\\nthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.\\n    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration\\nproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut\\nthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.\\n    He also called again for Congressional approval to explore\\noff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion\\nbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which\\nmay hold nine billion barrels.\\n    Herrington said he understood the Reagan\\'s reluctance to \\namend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these\\nproposals, but added he hoped his department\\'s energy/security\\nstudy would make a strong case for the need to help the\\nstruggling domestic oil industry.\\n    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even\\nthough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to\\nraise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to\\n100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.\\n    This, he said, would further bolster national security in\\ncase of an oil-supply disruption.\\n   \\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15000\" NEWID=\"9437\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 12:53:59.89</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>earn</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f1741&#31;reute\\nu f BC-TODD-SHIPYARDS-&lt;TOD>   03-25 0042</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>TODD SHIPYARDS &lt;TOD> OMITS COMMMON DIVIDEND</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    JERSEY CITY, N.J., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Todd Shipyards Corp said it\\nomitted payment of the quarterly dividend on its common stock\\nand lowered the dividend on its series A preferred stock to 75\\ncts from 77 cts a share.\\n    Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one\\nto shareholders of record April 15.\\n    The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover\\nboth losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and\\nincreased reserves for previously announced discontinued\\nshipyard operations.\\n    In addition, the company said its lenders agreed to\\ntemporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving\\ncredit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln.\\n    The reduction will hold through May 15, it said.\\n    Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement\\nallowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented\\nit from violating covenants of its credit agreement.\\n    The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to\\nextend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15.\\n    Todd added that it has suffered financially because of the\\nU.S. Navy\\'s unwillingness to release certain retentions under\\ncompleted ship construction contracts and a general decrease in\\nU.S. military spending.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14958\" NEWID=\"9438\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 12:56:27.95</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>earn</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f1751&#31;reute\\nr f BC-IMO-DELAVAL-&lt;IMD>-SET   03-25 0035</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>IMO DELAVAL &lt;IMD> SETS INITIAL DIVIDEND</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Imo Delaval said its board\\ndeclared an initial quarterly dividend of 14 cts per share,\\npayable April 24 to holders of record on April 6.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14959\" NEWID=\"9439\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 12:58:32.85</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;V RM\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f1753&#31;reute\\nb f BC-/-FED-TO-PURCHASE-TRE   03-25 0099</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>FED TO PURCHASE TREASURY BILLS FOR A CUSTOMER</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve will purchase\\napproximately one billion dlrs of U.S. Treasury bills for a\\ncustomer after the Treasury\\'s auction of four-year notes, a Fed\\nspokesman said.\\n    The spokesman said the Fed intends to purchase bills\\nmaturing in up to six months.\\n    Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-3/16 pct when\\nthe Fed announced the operation.

Huckaby, chairman\\nof the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar\\nissues, told Reuters in an interview.\\n    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year\\nthey must halt production increases, said he will deliver the\\nsame message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also\\nsaid he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.\\n    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic\\nsweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further\\ncuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.\\n    \"I think if we\\'re talking about dropping (the quota)\\nanother half mln tons, lets say, you\\'re getting to the point\\nwhere the program might not work,\" he said.\\n    \"Ideally, I\\'d like to freeze things right where we are,\"\\nsaid Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.\\n    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the\\ncurrent level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the\\nU.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports\\nholding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.\\n    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made\\nuntil 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.\\n    \"I feel like if we didn\\'t expand production, we could\\nprobably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through\\nthe 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),\"\\nHuckaby said.\\n    However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup\\nproducers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener\\nmarket from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.\\n    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will\\ncapture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in\\nthe U.S.\\n    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the\\nproduction of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further\\nexpanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports\\nmight be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.\\n    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner\\ncompanies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.\\n    \"This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have\\nsome natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the\\nprogram is preserved,\" Huckaby said.\\n    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to\\nthink about how domestic output could be controlled, either\\nthrough production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.\\n    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the\\nJustice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask\\ncorn refiners to limit production.\\n    \"I don\\'t know if we will go this route, but if we do\\nthere\\'s a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do\\nthat legally?\" he said.\\n    Asked if he would proceed with production controls without\\nthe support of corn refiners, Huckaby said \"You build a fragile\\nhouse if you do it that way.\"\\n    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers\\nhave expanded production, because high sugar price support\\nmeans returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such\\nas soybeans and grain.\\n    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would\\nnot be good policy.\\n    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to\\nsugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they\\nmay be penalized retroactively under any production control\\nlegislation passed next year.\\n    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in\\nthe sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration\\nproposal to drastically slash the program.\\n    \"The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don\\'t\\nthink it will get up a head of steam,\" Huckaby said.\\n    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price\\nsupport is unlikely to be approved.\\n    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,\\nHuckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint\\nwith the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the\\nEuropean Community\\'s sugar policy. He said EC policies are the\\nmajor cause of the depressed world sugar market.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14990\" NEWID=\"9471\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 13:42:51.52</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>italy</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;RM\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f1908&#31;reute\\nr f BC-FIAT-SAYS-IT-NOT-PLAN   03-25 0119</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>FIAT SAYS IT NOT PLANNING TO ISSUE EUROBONDS</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    Turin, Italy, March 25  - </DATELINE><BODY>Fiat Spa &lt;FIAT.MI> said it had no\\nplans to issue Eurobonds linked to shares still held by banks\\nafter the placement of the 15 pct Libyan stake in Fiat last\\nautumn, a company spokesman said.\\n   \"An eventual issue of bonds convertible into Fiat shares is\\nnot our responsibility,\" the spokesman told Reuters. \"In case the\\noperation should be finalized, the bonds would be issued by\\nbanks and not by Fiat, the spokesman said.\\n    The spokesman was commenting on West German press reports\\nthat Fiat is considering a Eurobond issue of up to 384 mln\\ndlrs, convertible or with warrants attached for exercise into\\nits shares still held by the banks.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"14991\" NEWID=\"9472\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 13:43:27.20</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>acq</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f1912&#31;reute\\nu f BC-INVESTORS-INCREASE-ST   03-25 0086</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>INVESTORS INCREASE STAKE IN FROST, SULLIVAN</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>One of a pair of private investors\\nin Frost and Sullivan Inc told the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission he increased his stake in the firm by about two pct,\\nto 15.4 pct.\\n    He is Theodore Cross, Princeton, N.J., editor of Business\\nand Society Review.\\n    The other investor is Mason Slaine, Cos Cob, Mass,\\npresident of Dealers\\' Digest Inc.

Growers fear they may find more empty\\npods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.\\n    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to\\n3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86\\nrecord of 3.34 mln hectares.\\n    The state of the crop continued to be good in general until\\nlast week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused\\ndamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.\\n    Where the rains were less heavy they were considered\\nbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.\\n    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in\\nsouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to\\ninfluence production forecasts.\\n    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where\\nrainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize\\nand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.\\n    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by\\nrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La\\nPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.\\n    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and\\n3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln\\nhectares in 1985/86.\\n    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at\\nbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.\\n    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to\\n12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production\\nand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.\\n    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the\\narea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires\\nalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.\\n    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is\\nimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of\\nsunshine dries the fields.\\n    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down\\n29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year\\'s record 3.14 mln hectares.\\n    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3\\nto 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of\\n4.1 mln tonnes.\\n    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the\\nrains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting\\nin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.\\n    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2\\npct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.\\n    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to\\n22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"NO\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15042\" NEWID=\"9522\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 14:45:36.02</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2092&#31;reute\\nd f BC-BETA-PHASE-&lt;BETA>-TO   03-25 0117</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>BETA PHASE &lt;BETA> TO SELL EYEGLASS TECHNOLOGY</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    MENLO PARK, Calif., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Beta Phase said it has\\nagreed to sell its shape-memory eyeglass frame manufacturing\\ntechnology and equipment to privately-held Universal Optical.\\n    The company said Universal Optical will also purchase the\\nexisting Beta Phase inventory of raw materials, its work in\\nprogress and its manufacturing equipment and tooling.\\n    Under the pact, Beta Phase will receive a 20 pct share of\\nCVI/Beta Ventures, a joint venture owned by Beta Group and\\nCooperVision Inc &lt;EYE>, which markets worldwide shape memory\\neyeglass frames.

</DATELINE><BODY>UAL Inc\\'s diversification into hotels\\nand rental cars may be its downfall, analysts said.\\n    Digesting its acquisitions of hotels, Pan Am Corp\\'s Pacific\\nair routes, and Hertz rental cars, combined with stiff air fare\\ncompetition has left the company with an undervalued stock\\nprice, analysts said.\\n    The vulnerability of UAL\\'s stock has fueled takeover\\nspeculation, as have reports that real estate magnate Donald\\nTrump has bought a large amount of its stock.\\n    Today, a UAL executive told Reuters its chairman Richard\\nFerris spoke with Trump last week. Trump said his interest in\\nthe stock was as an investment, but the executive said the\\ncompany does not know how much Trump owns or whether he has any\\nother plans.\\n    UAL senior vice president Kurt Stocker said the company\\nbelieves its diversification strategy will work since it can\\nfeed customers from one business to another. Several weeks ago,\\nit announced the new name of Allegis, to be taken in May.\\n    \"The strategy that Dick Ferris was talking about a couple\\nweeks ago when we announced the Allegis name is that the whole\\nreally ends up to be worth more than the sum of the parts.\\nUnfortunately, some people haven\\'t really come to this\\nunderstanding,\" Stocker said.\\n    But those same parts - Westin Hotels, Hertz rental cars,\\nUnited Airlines and its reservation system - also has Wall\\nStreet calculating a wide range of breakup values from about\\n100 dlrs per share to 130 dlrs per share.\\n    Analysts aren\\'t so sure the strategy is going to work. They\\nmention Transworld Corp, initially Trans World Airlines,\\nas an example of an airline diversification gone wrong.\\nTransworld Corp ended up spinning off its TWA airline.\\nTransworld, now TW Services, is selling Hilton International to\\nUAL.\\n    \"If you want to be negatively biased you say it\\'s a stupid\\nphilosophy, and if you\\'re United and you put billions of dlrs\\ninto other acquisitions, this is a good idea. There\\'s not much\\nevidence one way or the other,\" said Dean Witter analyst Mark\\nDaugherty.\\n    \"In the short or long run, they all (UAL\\'s businesses) make\\nmoney and perform well,\" said Stocker. He said the stock price\\nhasn\\'t caught on since the strategy is relatively new.\\n    Analysts say it\\'s because earnings are relatively poor.\\nEarnings last year were 25 cts per share. Louis Marckesano of\\nJanney Montgomery predicts 1987 net of 3.50 dlrs per share.\\n    \"They\\'re potential is enormous. I think their problem has\\nbeen execution. The strike was the single biggest factor that\\nset them back in 1985. Last year, the whole industry was\\ninvolved in fare wars.

</DATELINE><BODY>Blizzard conditions in parts of the\\nwest and southwest U.S. severely stressed beef cattle and\\nKansas cattlemen are reporting death losses from the storm,\\naccording to livestock associations in the area.\\n    Talk among futures traders that cattle had died from the\\ncold and blowing snow accounted for some of the strength in\\nLive Cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange today.\\n    \"Death (of cattle) can be directly attributed to the storm,\\nbut it\\'s hard to get a handle on a number,\" Todd Domer,\\ndirector of communications for the Kansas Livestock Association\\nsaid.\\n    Domer noted that limited reports have been filtering in of\\ndeath losses at feedyards and from grazing and cow/calf\\noperations. Western Kansas was hardest hit while Eastern Kansas\\nonly had rain, he said.\\n    Paul Johnston of the Nebraska Livestock Feeders Association\\nsaid, \"There\\'s no question that baby calves coming in that kind\\nof blizzard are probably not going to make it.\"\\n    We were having such a nice winter and the cows were out\\ncalving before the storm hit, he added.\\n    The worst part of the storm came through the center of the\\nstate. Precipitation was generally in the form of wet snow and\\nsome feedlots are already like \"soup\", he said, inhibiting\\ncattle movements.\\n    The storm also had an effect on weight gain of larger\\nanimals. Drifting snow caused problems in moving feed and mud\\nmade it hard for cattle to reach the feed once it was\\navailable.\\n    Domer noted that feedyards sources say a tremendous cutback\\nhas occurred in feed consumption by cattle in the yards, which\\nmay or may not lead to sickness over the next several days.\\nCattle reduced daily feed consumption to about 12 lbs from 25\\nduring the worst of the blizzard, he said.\\n    Mud will be more a problem as the weather breaks and snow\\nmelts. Mud adds to stress on full-grown animals and endangers\\nsmaller ones which can fall and be trampled in pens. The cost\\nof feeding rises as animals generally consume more in cold\\nweather, Domer said.\\n    Domer said it will be at least 10 days before yards get\\nback to normal.\\n    Roy Gallant, from Accu Weather Services, said that although\\nthe worst of the storm is over, there are still some strong\\ngusty winds which will not diminish until tonight.\\n    The storm started late Sunday night in West Kansas and is\\njust now winding down.

The GAO then decided to\\nre-examine the costs, sources said.\\n    The issue is an important one, because congressional budget\\ncommittees are known to be considering limiting the use of\\ncertificates as a means of cutting spending.\\n    Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior\\nAssociate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the\\nSenate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.\\n    Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are\\nuncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared\\nto cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,\\nCCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.\\n    USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents\\nto store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in\\ngovernment storage.\\n    It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress\\' investigative\\narm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the\\ngovernment more to use certificates instead of cash in farm\\nprice and income support programs, Reagan administration\\nsources said.\\n    The GAO is expected to point out that use of\\npayment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight\\nstorage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been\\nsold.\\n    The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director\\nBrian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees\\nintensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal\\nbudget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of\\nPIK certificates.\\n    The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or\\ncerts, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to\\nfarmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to\\nrepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or\\ncash.\\n    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion\\ndlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another\\n6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and\\nAugust 1987, according to USDA.\\n    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily\\nbecause recipients can use the certificates to pay back\\ngovernment loans at levels below the loan rate.\\n    Eliminating this practice, called \"PIK and roll,\" would save\\nthe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to\\nthe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according\\nto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates\\ncost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.\\n    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be\\nconsidering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other\\nsavings alternatives.\\n    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the\\nestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date\\nhave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln\\ndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one\\nadministration official said.\\n    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates\\nbased in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.\\n    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable\\nto the different effect certificates can have on market prices\\nover the course of a crop year.\\n    USDA\\'s Economic Research Service, for example, has found\\nthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of\\ncorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by\\nbetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel.\\n    Between September and November, however, certificates had\\nonly a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS\\nstudy, obtained by Reuters.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15189\" NEWID=\"9668\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 18:45:15.44</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>acq</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>canada</D><D>uk</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;E\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2706&#31;reute\\nr f BC-DAILY-TELEGRAPH-IN-DE   03-25 0109</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>DAILY TELEGRAPH IN DEAL WITH NEWS INTERNATIONAL</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Hollinger Inc> said 58 pct-owned &lt;The\\nDaily Telegraph PLC>, of London, agreed to form a joint venture\\nprinting company in Manchester, England with &lt;News\\nInternational PLC>.

We are exceedingly profitable,\" a\\nspokesman for the firm told Reuters.\\n    The rumors that have swirled around Drexel, more than any\\nother broker, have involved concerns that its business will be\\nthreatened by the Federal probe, say Wall Street sources. The\\nfirm has long been at the leading edge of the mergers business\\nand had ties to now-disgraced speculator Ivan Boesky.\\n    In the latest chapter of the story, Drexel said that some\\ncommodities firms have begun to limit the amount of business\\nthey will do with the firm, citing credit risks. Drexel has\\nlong been a powerful competitor in precious metals markets.\\n    But Drexel spokesman Steve Anredder told Reuters that\\nDrexel\\'s overall business is proceeding normally and the\\nfirst-quarter profit \"could be the strongest of anybody on Wall\\nStreet.\"\\n    \"I wouldn\\'t say we\\'re not feeling any effect (from the\\ntrading probes),\" he said. \"But we\\'re doing extremely well.\"\\n    The firm was among the first to be subpoenaed in the\\ngovernment\\'s wide-ranging probe of illegal trading involving\\nthe use of confidential company information on Wall Street.\\n    Believed to be under particular scrutiny was Drexel\\'s \"junk\\nbond\" operation -- the issuance of high-risk speculative debt\\nthat it pioneered for financing corporate takeovers.\\n    \"We have done nothing wrong,\" said the Drexel spokesman.\\n\"After a thorough investigation, we have found no evidence of\\nany wrongdoing by the firm or anyone within the firm.\"\\n    The spokesman said that in the aftermath of the Boesky\\narrest, Drexel had not been charged. Nor had any individual at\\nthe firm been charged with illegal acts while employed by\\nDrexel. One of its top merger specialists, Martin Siegel, was\\ncharged in connection with a former job.\\n    Still, more than any other firm on Wall Street, Drexel has\\nsuffered the consequences of the insider trading probe. To\\nbegin with, there have been a series of brief shocks in the\\njunk bond market, in nervousness linked to rumors that Drexel\\nmight be in trouble.\\n    At one point, Drexel said Wednesday, a large Midwest bank\\nrefused to allow Drexel-issued bonds as collateral on credit\\nlines. Two weeks ago, the restriction was withdrawn, it said.\\n    The company also was notified last month that the outside\\ninsurer of Drexel\\'s individual brokerage accounts had decided\\nnot to renew coverage. Drexel has set up its own subsidiary\\nhandling part of the insurance. American International Group\\nand a group of British underwriters have handled the rest.\\n    Drexel also appears to have lost ground to others in the\\nmergers and acquisition business recently, market sources said.\\nHowever, Anredder said that there was no sign that Drexel had\\nlost any customers at all owing to the insider trading cases.\\nBut in citing results for the quarter, the company points\\nmostly to other areas of success.\\n    Corporate financings have totaled 8 billion dlrs, including\\n3 billion dlrs in new junk bonds in the January-March period,\\nDrexel said. Drexel maintains the lion\\'s share of this\\nlucrative business, trade sources noted.\\n    The market for junk bonds, although jittery, \"has rallied\\nback with a vengeance,\" Anredder said.\\n    Although they see new competition in the junk bond arena,\\nmarket sources concur that Drexel remains king of the hill.\\n    While some of the leading Wall Street firms were limiting\\nhead-to-head dealings with Drexel in the commodity markets \\nbased on worries over the credit of the company, the Drexel\\nspokesman called this \"ridiculous.\"\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15201\" NEWID=\"9680\">\\n<DATE>25-MAR-1987 19:04:37.95</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>coffee</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>brazil</D><D>mexico</D><D>guatemala</D><D>el-salvador</D><D>honduras</D><D>costa-rica</D><D>nicaragua</D><D>panama</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;C T\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f2745&#31;reute\\nu f BC-NO-CHANGE-IN-BRAZIL\\'S   03-25 0095</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>DAUSTER SAYS NO CHANGE IN BRAZIL\\'S COFFEE POLICY</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, MARCH 25 -

Tokyo was last laid flat in 1923 by a tremor reading\\n7.8, raising the spectre of another within five years.\\n    Seismic experts at Shizuoka, one of three areas near Tokyo\\nconsidered quake-prone, say they expect a major earthquake\\nwithin the next few years.\\n    Added to such fears is the fact that no developed nation\\nhas suffered a major quake since the far-reaching changes in\\nthe last two decades which have bound the global economy into a\\ncomplex, fragile, interdependent financial network.\\n    \"We are reaching a dangerous time. Insurance companies are\\nstarting to worry about how to cover the large losses,\" said\\nHatsuho Narita, a manager at the British Insurance Group.\\n    \"It\\'s a theme that has worried a lot of people. It\\'s\\ndifficult to put a figure on it, but the impact on all world\\nmarkets would be considerable,\" Brian Waterhouse, a banking\\nexpert at brokerage James Capel in Tokyo, told Reuters.\\n    What would happen?\\n    Consider that Tokyo and its six surrounding prefectures\\naccount for up to 40 pct of Japanese gross national product, or\\nsome six pct of world GNP.\\n    Some economists believe that in the immediate aftermath of\\na Tokyo quake, the yen would rise against sterling because of\\nthe large amount of reinsurance which would fall due in London.\\nBut it would plunge against other currencies.\\n    This would worsen the dramatic loss of value in land and\\nassets in the Tokyo area. Banks would be left holding hundreds\\nof billions of dollars in worthless mortgages and loans.\\n    Bankers estimate that 50 to 70 pct of city and regional\\nbanks\\' loan exposure is to smaller business, which would most\\nlikely lose all in a quake. Up to nine pct of their exposure is\\nin housing and consumer loans, they said.\\n    Many smaller banks and some larger ones would go to the\\nwall, bankers polled by Reuters said.\\n    The government, aware that insurance claims would be huge,\\nhas set a payout ceiling of 10 mln yen per private house. In\\nTokyo, 100 mln yen buys only a very modest residence.\\n    In addition, the insurance industry has formed the Japan\\nEarthquake Reinsurance Co to cover housing to a total of 10\\nbillion dlrs, 80 pct of it government-guaranteed.\\n    However, insurers said the industrial sector, which has no\\ngovernment backing, is a more dangerous risk.\\n    Japanese insurers said they are finding it increasingly\\ndifficult to find reinsurance abroad.\\n    \"Overseas firms are now very alert to earthquake insurance\\nrisks,\" said Tahashi Kumakiri, Foreign Department head at the\\nJapan Non-life Insurance Association.\\n    Due to limited world insurance capacity, the Finance\\nMinistry recommends a coverage limit of 15 to 30 pct of\\nJapanese firms\\' total insurable value.\\n    Even so, one insurer believes that local firms reinsure up\\nto 80 pct of their quake cover overseas, most of it through\\nLloyds of London.\\n    Some of this reinsurance is then reinsured again,\\ncompounding the risks should the money suddenly be called in.\\n    Foreign entities in Japan are allowed 100 pct quake cover\\nbut foreign insurers now set a limit of 60 pct.\\n    Industrial cover is confidential but official figures show\\nthat in fiscal 1985/86 ended March 31, Japan did about half a\\nbillion dlrs of overseas reinsurance business in fire cover,\\nmost of which is quake-related.\\n    Bankers said the destruction of underlying assets and\\nrepatriation of huge amounts of Japanese overseas investment\\nwould seriously affect overseas stock and bond markets.\\n    Japanese institutions buy a net 10 billion dlrs or so of\\nforeign bonds a month, much of it U.S. Treasuries, and are\\npurchasing more and more U.S. And European stocks. The value of\\nforeign holdings of Japanese securities would nosedive.\\n    Japan would need huge amounts of money over a long period\\nto rebuild, which would block out developing nation creditors\\nfrom existing capital resources, the bankers said.\\n    Loss of central computers would mean billions in lost\\ntransactions, bankers noted.\\n    Oil traders said crude prices would plummet as imports fell\\nby up to half from some three mln barrels per day now.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15244\" NEWID=\"9723\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 02:50:21.33</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>earn</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0106&#31;reute\\nf f BC-Hoechst-AG-1986-world   03-26 0013</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT TYPE=\"BRIEF\">&#2;\\n******<TITLE>Hoechst AG 1986 world group pretax profit 3.21 billion marks vs 3.16 billion\\n</TITLE>Blah blah blah.\\n&#3;\\n\\n</TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15245\" NEWID=\"9724\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 02:56:13.45</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>australia</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;RM\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0111&#31;reute\\nu f BC-AIDC-ISSUES-FIRST-AUS   03-26 0101</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>AIDC ISSUES FIRST AUSTRALIAN DLR MEDIUM TERM NOTES</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian Industry Development\\nCorp (AIDC) said it issued 20 mln Australian dlrs of five-year\\nnotes in London.\\n    The notes, issued in denominations of 50,000 dlrs, were\\npart of a 10-year, one billion U.S. Dlr multicurrency facility\\nestablished last December, it said in a statement.\\n    Medium-term Euronotes had previously only been issued in\\nU.S. Dlrs, it said.\\n    The AIDC last week said it issued under the same facility\\nthe first of several five mln Australian dlr-denominated\\nEuro-commercial paper tranches in Asia.\\n    Dealers for the one billion U.S. Dlr borrowing program were\\nthe AIDC, &lt;Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd>, &lt;Merrill Lynch\\nInternational and Co>, &lt;Morgan Stanley International>, &lt;Salomon\\nBrothers International Ltd> and &lt;Swiss Bank Corp International\\nLtd>, the AIDC said.\\n    &lt;Citibank N.A.> was the issuing and paying agent.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"NO\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15246\" NEWID=\"9725\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 02:59:52.21</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>japan</D><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0120&#31;reute\\nu f BC-MAZDA-DOES-NOT-PLAN-T   03-26 0103</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>MAZDA DOES NOT PLAN TO MAKE SPORTS CARS IN U.S.</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mazda Motor Corp &lt;MAZT.T> has no plans to\\nproduce sports cars in the U.S., A company spokesman said.\\n    A Japanese daily paper said Mazda would switch production\\nof its RX-7 sports car, which is popular in the U.S., To the\\nU.S. Over the next three years to minimise losses caused by the\\nyen\\'s rise against the dollar.\\n    Mazda\\'s wholly owned subsidiary &lt;Mazda Motor Manufacturing\\n(USA) Corp> (MMUC) in Flatrock, Michigan, is due to start\\nproducing Mazda 626 saloon cars from September at an annual\\nrate of 240,000, the company said on March 2.\\n    One of Ford Motor Co\\'s &lt;F> Japanese distributors, &lt;Autorama\\nInc>, said recently it was considering importing the\\nMMUC-manufactured cars.

He said expenditures for the past two\\nyears have been inflated.\\n    Investment by localities in capital construction in 1987\\nmust fall by 50 pct from the 1986 level and state firms must\\ncut their losses by 30 pct, he said.\\n    China will use 14.6 billion yuan in foreign loans in 1987,\\nup from 7.87 billion in 1986, Wang said.\\n    It must cut back on investment in capital construction,\\nespecially construction outside the state plan, he said. Funds\\nmust go into energy, transport, telecommunications, raw and\\nsemi-finished materials and not into non-production sectors.\\n    \"In view of the country\\'s financial difficulties this year,\\nit has been decided that seven billion yuan of the budgetary\\nallocation for capital construction will be raised by the\\nPeople\\'s Bank through loans and the issuing of bonds,\" he said.\\n    Wang said all localities and departments must strictly\\nconfine their 1987 capital investment to the amount set out in\\nthe state budget, a 50 pct reduction from 1986 levels.\\n    He said that because of financial difficulties, the state\\ncannot increase spending on culture, education, science and\\npublic health in 1987 at the same rate as over the past few\\nyears. Expenditure in those sectors will rise by two pct.\\n    The only allocations not to be affected by the general 10\\npct cutback are subsidies for price rises, repayment of\\nprincipal and interest on domestic and foreign loans, funds for\\nthe disabled and spending for other social relief.\\n    Wang said state firms must cut their total losses by 30 pct\\nfrom the 1986 level, overhead expenses by 10 pct and raw\\nmaterial consumption by two pct. Commercial firms must cut\\ntheir deficits by 20 pct and running costs by two pct.\\n    He said violations of financial and economic discipline are\\ncommon, including tax evasion, false accounting, embezzlement,\\ntheft, extravagance and accepting and offering bribes. Such\\npractices \"have reached very serious proportions in some areas,\\ndepartments and units\" and must be dealt with seriously, he\\nsaid.\\n    Wang said 11.4 billion yuan worth of foreign loans have\\nbeen arranged according to the 1986-90 plan, with 3.2 billion\\ngoing to pay for foreign equipment in the Baoshan steel plant\\nnear Shanghai.\\n    He said China is running no risk in using more foreign\\nloans, provided it prepares careful feasibility studies,\\nborrows only what it can repay and uses the loans only to\\ndevelop production in priority sectors.\\n    Wang said China plans to levy new taxes on the use of\\narable land for non-farm purposes starting this year. Half the\\nrevenue generated will go to the state and half to localities\\nto be used in the development of agriculture.\\n    The only new spending is 11 billion yuan to be used to\\ncover tax reductions and increased subsidies for big and\\nmedium-size state firms and textile and other light industries.\\nThe money will also pay for increases in the state purchasing\\nprices of some grain, cotton and oil-yielding crops, he said.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15254\" NEWID=\"9733\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 03:46:10.54</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>acq</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>uk</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;RM F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0178&#31;reute\\nb f BC-BP-TO-OFFER-7.4-BILLI   03-26 0083</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said it\\nintended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil\\nCo &lt;SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for\\na total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.\\n    The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc>\\nunit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The\\noffer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares\\nbeing tendered.\\n    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based\\non its own valuation as well as those of its financial\\nadvisers. It took into account reviews of both public and\\nnon-public information.\\n    Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down\\n1-3/4 dlrs.\\n    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at\\nlast night\\'s close.\\n    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP\\'s\\nown resources.\\n    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from\\nbanks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and\\npartly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The\\ncompany said it was in the course of arranging these\\nfacilities.\\n    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group\\'s\\ninvestment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full\\nownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be\\nmade without the limitations of a minority interest.\\n    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum\\nuse of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices\\nwere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the\\ninvestment.\\n    Walters added that it also felt that, due to management\\nchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even\\nin a lower oil price environment.\\n    Standard\\'s net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs\\nand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before\\ntax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.\\n    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.\\nOne noted that it was not immediately clear why the group\\nshould spend so much money buying a company it already\\ncontrolled.\\n    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard\\nshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.\\n    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on\\nthe U.K. Government\\'s recent announcement that it intended to\\ndispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the\\n1987/88 financial year, analysts said.\\n    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted\\nthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would\\ndepend on the reaction of the markets.\\n    The deal would probably push BP\\'s gearing up to around 59\\npct from 20 pct currently, he said.\\n    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not\\nrepeat last year\\'s rapid drop the prospects for Standard\\nreturning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from\\nits cash flow -- were good.\\n    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.\\n    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to\\nmake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from\\nproduction and its downstream activities would push it\\ncomfortably into surplus.\\n    BP initially took a stake in Standard following the\\ndiscovery of oil in Alaska\\'s Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had\\ninadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,\\nwhich was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude\\noil.\\n    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management\\nreorganisation of Standard in the past year.\\n    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was\\nnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the\\ntender offer, Spedding said.\\n    BP\\'s willingness to take hard decisions such as major\\nbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well\\nreceived in the markets.\\n    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially\\nafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division\\n-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come\\nstraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by\\nother sectors.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15255\" NEWID=\"9734\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 03:53:37.61</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>earn</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>west-germany</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0186&#31;reute\\nu f BC-HOECHST-RAISES-PROFIT   03-26 0106</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a\\nstatement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a\\nfall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.\\n    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and\\nother currencies against the mark.

But the current\\naccount surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus\\nrecorded in February 1986.\\n    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the\\nFebruary current account surplus compared with January was due\\nto seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account\\nfigures are seasonally adjusted.\\n    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled\\n32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986\\nbut a rise of 5.5 pct against January.\\n    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56\\nbillion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct\\ncompared with January.\\n    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate\\nthe real change in exports and imports in February. But for\\ncomparison purposes it noted that in January the average value\\nof imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average\\nvalue of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.\\n    Within the current account, the services account had 300\\nmln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark\\nsurplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark\\ndeficit.\\n    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in\\nvalue terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a\\nyear earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,\\na decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.\\n    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for\\nJanuary/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1\\nbillion marks in the year-ago period.\\n    The cumulative current account surplus for January and\\nFebruary 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion\\nmarks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.\\n    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus\\nreflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as\\nseasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier\\nthis week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against\\nJanuary while export prices were unchanged.\\n    \"The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend\\nthat is not expected to change for several months at least,\"\\nsaid an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987\\nas a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record\\n112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the\\nsurplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.\\n    An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in\\nFrankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a\\nmore accurate picture of West Germany\\'s trade position.\\n    He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and\\nFebruary together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus\\nposted in November and December.\\n    \"The trend is clearly lower,\" he said.\\n    This economist, who declined to be named, said the February\\nrise was also partly explained by special factors in January,\\nwhen there had been a number of public holidays as well as\\nextremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15270\" NEWID=\"9750\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 05:24:48.36</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>france</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;RM\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0333&#31;reute\\nb f BC-MONTREAL-TRUSTCO-ISSU   03-26 0083</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>MONTREAL TRUSTCO ISSUES CANADIAN DOLLAR EUROBOND</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Montreal Trustco Inc is issuing a 100 mln\\nCanadian dlr, 8-1/2 pct bond due May 6, 1992 at 101 pct, lead\\nmanager Societe Generale said.\\n    The non-callable issue is of unsecured, unsubordinated\\ndebt.

He said bidding would be either\\nopen-priced, if there were enough serious contenders, or the\\nAPT would set a target price for acquisition. He added that the\\ntarget price did not constitute a rigid floor.\\n    \"What we consider an acceptable price is a price at which an\\ninvestor will earn an adequate return,\" he said.\\n    SyCip said the bulk of the APT\\'s current work relates to\\nthe non-performing assets of the state-owned Development Bank\\nof the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank\\n(PNB). The APT was set up in January.\\n    SyCip said about 75 pct of the 400-odd assets that the DBP\\nand the PNB are handing over to the APT are still in the form\\nof financial assets.\\n    \"In some cases financial assets have been converted into\\nphysical assets by foreclosures. They are fairly cut and dried\\nbecause we are dealing with mostly whole production facilities\\nlike textile or food-processing plants,\" he said.\\n    \"Financial assets are more complicated. The only recourse is\\nto foreclose, gain titles, and try to sell the asset, but the\\nlaws here tend to favour the debtors,\" he added.\\n    SyCip said although the APT is protected from prosecution\\nby its charter, many debtors are tying up the panel with\\nlitigation.\\n    \"If you see some of the situations we have to work our way\\nthrough you will see that our symbol, a Gordian knot, is an apt\\nillustration,\" he said.\\n    SyCip said the PNB has not succeeded in foreclosing on 16\\nof the 17 sugar factories it wants to sell because of the high\\ncosts involved. \"When you do your arithmetic you realise that if\\nyou did foreclose your recovery would be only a fraction of the\\nasset\\'s book exposure,\" he said.\\n    SyCip said the APT was not worried about whether associates\\nof former President Ferdinand Marcos, who originally owned many\\nof the bankrupt companies, would buy them back through the\\nprivatisation scheme.\\n    \"We just look at the bottom line, which is to monetise these\\nassets to the maximum degree possible,\" he said. \"We are selling\\nfor cash, it is not our concern where it comes from.\"\\n    He said he had told cabinet ministers sceptical about the\\nidentities of buyers that \"Marcos cronies\" could easily put up\\nlegitimate fronts if they were specifically barred from bidding\\nfor assets on the block.\\n    \"I told them if I am paid 20 mln pesos in 100-peso bills,\\nall with identical serial numbers and they look like genuine\\nlegal currency, then I would accept them\\',\" SyCip said.\\n    He said some participants in the government\\'s debt-equity\\nswap scheme were interested in buying non-performing assets\\nwith the pesos they receive from such deals. The problem is\\ngovernment regulations slow down approval of debt-equity plans\\nand the APT normally demands full payment within 15 days.\\n    \"The Central Bank and Monetary Board could also look at\\ninvestment funds earmarked for non-performing asset purchases,\"\\nhe said. \"It would greatly facilitate matters.\"\\n    SyCip said last month the APT hoped to recover about 24\\nbillion pesos of the assets\\' total worth of 108 billion.\\n    President Corazon Aquino announced earlier this month that\\nproceeds from the sale of APT-controlled assets would be used\\nto finance the government\\'s land reform program, which aims to\\ndistribute about 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.\\n    Asked why the APT did not favour Filipino buyers, SyCip\\nsaid: \"How much money has the country to lose because of this\\n\\'Filipinos first\\' slogan?

The dollar was sold anyway.\\n    Yesterday\\'s comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris\\naccord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.\\n    The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul\\nVolcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,\\nwhich a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a\\nhalt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they\\nnoted.\\n    The situation has again raised the question of whether\\nintervention can succeed against the trend in today\\'s huge\\ncurrency markets. Dealers said the market\\'s cool response to\\nintervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.\\n    \"This means that the current dollar selling is not of a\\nsheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,\" said Koichi\\nMiyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.\\n    Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the\\nintervention and it is only a matter of time before some\\noperators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in\\nTokyo today at 149.40 against New York\\'s 149.30/40. Its record\\nlow was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.\\n    Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to\\nrise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven\\nindustrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.\\n    The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus\\nItaly) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies\\napart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.\\n    Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be\\nused and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris\\naccord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to\\nprevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.\\nTrade deficit, especially with Japan.\\n    Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a\\nlower dollar is also limiting Washington\\'s options, they said.\\n    The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow\\nthe dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said\\nTadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.\\n    Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large\\nforward dollar sales from April to June for export bills\\nfalling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.\\n    The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen\\ndepreciation, dealers said.\\n    Yesterday\\'s request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of\\nInternational Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks\\nineffective in light of this real demand, they said.\\n    The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar\\nsales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new\\nbusiness year starting April 1, dealers said.\\n    \"The market seems to have established a new dollar trading\\nrange between 147 and 149 yen,\" one dealer said.\\n    The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris\\naccord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low\\nend for the dollar against the yen, he said.\\n    Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148\\nyen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to\\n145.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15286\" NEWID=\"9765\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 06:32:20.12</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>austria</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;RM\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0462&#31;reute\\nb f BC-AUSTRIA-MAKES-TWO-BIL   03-26 0102</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>AUSTRIA MAKES TWO BILLION SCHILLING NOTE ISSUE</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    VIENNA, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Austria is making a two billion\\nschilling issue of floating rate treasury notes carrying\\ninterest of 1/8th of a point over the three-month Vienna\\nInterbank Offered Rate (VIBOR), lead manager Oesterreichische\\nLaenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] said.\\n    The issue, to be made at par, carries a placing fee of 20\\nbasis points and will be listed in Vienna, a Laenderbank\\nofficial told Reuters.\\n    The issue will have an initial three-year life and the\\nissuer has the right to make two three-year extensions and a\\nfurther one-year extension to 1997.\\n    Payment and closing date is April 23 and redemption will be\\non the same date at the end of each of the periods.\\n    The notes, in one mln schilling denominations, may not be\\noffered in Austria, Britain or the United States.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15287\" NEWID=\"9766\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 06:33:20.12</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>france</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;RM\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0465&#31;reute\\nu f BC-FRANCE\\'S-CAECL-ISSUES   03-26 0090</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>FRANCE\\'S CAECL ISSUES THREE BILLION FRANC BOND</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caisse d\\'Aide a l\\'Equipement des\\nCollectivites Locales (CAECL) is issuing a three billion franc\\ntwo-tranche domestic bond, the lead managers said.\\n    The first two billion franc tranche at a fixed rate of 8.90\\npct is led by Credit Lyonnais, Banque Indosuez and Union de\\nGarantie et de Placement, with Credit Lyonnais as book-runner.\\n    The non-callable, 13 year and 80 days bond is issued at\\n100.419 pct.

In the majority of cases, people had\\nperfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wanting\\nthe bank to know their identity, Oesch said.\\n    The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for a\\nvirtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy with\\nthe new code.\\n    However, critics complain that the agreement does not go\\nfar enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still be\\ncircumvented by criminals.\\n    \"No other group in society is allowed to regulate itself as\\nmuch as the banks,\" complained Meier of the Social Democrats. \"I\\nhope that the Banking Commission exercises its proper control\\nfunction.\"\\n    However, other parts of the agreement won praise.\\n    In particular, banks will also now be required to demand\\nthe identity anyone doing more than 100,000 Swiss francs worth\\nof business with them, even if they do not have an account at\\nthe bank. Until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.\\n    Peter Kluser, head of the National Bank\\'s legal department,\\nwhich had argued for a lower limit, said the move could help\\ncombat the use of banks to \"launder\" or hide the criminal origin\\nof money.\\n    The new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunal\\nable to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect the\\ncode.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15296\" NEWID=\"9775\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 07:12:10.44</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>france</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;E A\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0517&#31;reute\\nr f BC-MONTREAL-TRUSTCO-ISSU   03-26 0082</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>MONTREAL TRUSTCO ISSUES CANADIAN DOLLAR EUROBOND</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Montreal Trustco Inc is issuing a 100 mln\\nCanadian dlr, 8-1/2 pct bond due May 6, 1992 at 101 pct, lead\\nmanager Societe Generale said.\\n    The non-callable issue is of unsecured, unsubordinated\\ndebt.

The one mln tonne upward revision in\\n1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.\\nThe IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to\\n87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.\\n    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and\\ncoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln\\nagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln\\nrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.\\n    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is\\nlikely to be down from last year as low world prices and\\nrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.\\n    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a\\ndrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There\\nis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the\\nIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.\\n    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain\\noutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the\\nEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is\\nexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.\\n    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union\\nplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln\\nhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are\\nlikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved\\nweather and a further increase in the use of intensive\\ncultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet\\nmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.\\n    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be\\nbolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC\\nsaid.\\n    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at\\nend&#127;of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln\\ntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.\\n    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln\\ntonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of\\nanother large crop this coming season with higher output\\nexpected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15304\" NEWID=\"9783\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 07:22:45.10</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>money-fx</D><D>dlr</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>japan</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;A\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0559&#31;reute\\nu f BC-BANK-OF-JAPAN-BUYS-SM   03-26 0101</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN BUYS SMALL QUANTITY DOLLARS -DEALERS</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan was thought to have\\nbought a small amount of dollars at around 149.30/40 yen,\\ndealers said.\\n    The dollar fluctuated marginally after the small-scale\\nintervention, believed to total several tens of mlns of dlrs,\\nthey said.

At some time during that period all the\\nproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.\\n    These changes did not always result in lower export\\nsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more\\nthan offset lower prices in the domestic currency.\\n    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention\\nprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European\\ncurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which\\nmost export transactions are denominated, the intervention\\nprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of\\nsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers\\nand some governments are now searching for ways to cut\\nexpenditure, the report says.\\n    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five\\nmajor exporters declined in the period covered by the survey\\nfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to\\nincreased production in China and India.\\n    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was\\ncountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower\\nacreages.\\n    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per\\ncent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to\\nother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.\\nAcreages are attributed to official incentives.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15314\" NEWID=\"9794\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 08:08:13.06</DATE>\\n<TOPICS></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>uk</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;RM\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0687&#31;reute\\nu f BC-SANDOZ-HAS-50-MLN-DLR   03-26 0077</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>SANDOZ HAS 50 MLN DLR EURO-CP PROGRAM</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sandoz Corp, a U.S. Subsidiary of Sandoz\\nAG, is establishing a 50 mln dlr euro-commercial paper (CP)\\nprogram, Morgan Guaranty Ltd said as one of the dealers.\\n    The other dealer is Swiss Bank Corp International Ltd and\\nMorgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York is issuing and paying\\nagent.\\n    Paper will have maturities between seven and 183 days and\\nwill be issued in global and definitive form.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15315\" NEWID=\"9795\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 08:11:00.22</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>trade</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE><D>james-baker</D></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;V\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0703&#31;reute\\nu f BC-U.S.-TREASURY\\'S-BAKER   03-26 0114</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY\\'S BAKER OPPOSES TAX INCREASE</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\\nsaid that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the\\nbudget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.\\n    \"I don\\'t think it\\'s (a tax increase) is a very good idea\\nand I\\'m quite confident that President Reagan doesn\\'t think\\nit\\'s a very good idea,\" Baker said in an interview on Cable\\nNews Network\\'s \"Moneyline\" television program.\\n    He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP\\nwhich is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal\\nGovernment is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP.

That was the date\\nof the first Mexican debt crisis.\\n    After months of haggling, a proposed rescheduling agreement\\nfor Mexico was struck last September during the annual meeting\\nof the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in\\nWashington.\\n    Ever since then the advisory group, of which Lloyds is a\\nmember, has been attempting to round up the needed signatories.\\n    However, there has been considerable resistance to the\\npackage, partly because of some of the clauses it contains and\\npartly because many small U.S. Regional banks do not want to\\nincrease their exposure to any Latin American countries.\\n    Brougham said, \"We (British banks) have always played along\\nfor Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally.\"\\n    The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six\\nclearers jointly, but each sent its own telex.\\n    In addition to Lloyds, telexes were sent by National\\nWestminster Bank Plc, Barclays Bank Plc, Midland Bank Plc,\\n&#127;tandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.\\n    Brougham noted that so far the U.S. Banks have only reached\\n83-1/2 pct of the total that is expected from them, while the\\nlevel of contributions from the U.K. Banks is well in excess of\\n90 pct. \"The U.S. Figure should be closer to ours,\" he said.\\n    Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the\\nregional U.S. Banks, noting that even if they don\\'t contribute\\nto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the\\nexisting loans.\\n    The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and\\nbankers are hoping all will go according to plan.\\n    In the meantime, bankers expect further pressure will be\\nexercised on the regional banks and the major U.S. Banks to\\nfind a solution to the problem. Many have suggested that the\\nlarger U.S. Banks should take on the additional obligations,\\nbut so far they have resisted this.\\n    Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the U.S. Banks\\nwill come from U.S. Regulators, notably the Federal Reserve.\\n    Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the British\\nbanks and other national groups as \"a matter of principal, and\\nburden sharing\" rather than as a \"pressure tactic\" to force the\\nU.S. Banks to make up their share.\\n    The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the\\nprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement.\\n    The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays. At\\nthe signing in New York last Friday, Finance Minister Gustavo\\nPetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks.\\n    \"Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will\\ncontinue to be open and willing to share with them the business\\nopportunities which its future growth will create,\" Petricioli\\nsaid.\\n    Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexico\\nis one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their\\nexposure. But Mexico halted its debt for equity program in\\nFebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package.\\n    On Friday, Petricioli said \"We will be a lot more\\nexpeditious in processing the requests of banks that have\\nsupported us.\"\\n    The pressure on the U.S. Banks comes at a time when other\\nmajor Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debt\\nnegotiations.\\n    Brazil, the third world\\'s largest debtor, has suspended all\\ninterest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt. Many\\nof the major U.S. Banks, including Citibank, have already said\\nthey might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis and\\ntake the financial losses, which could total billions of\\ndollars.\\n    This would be required by U.S. Banking regulations if the\\ninterest payments are more than 90 days overdue.\\n    However, the U.S. Banks are not the only ones threatened by\\nregulations. In the U.K., A proposed Inland Revenue ruling\\nwould affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans, many\\nof which are made to Latin American countries.\\n    Basically, the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bank\\ncan claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loan\\ninterest payments.\\n    The British banks are planning to fight the proposals as\\ntheir implementation could prove extremely costly, not just in\\nterms of compliance but in limiting future business.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15357\" NEWID=\"9836\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 09:06:45.47</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>trade</D><D>bop</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>hong-kong</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;A\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0880&#31;reute\\nd f BC-HONG-KONG-FEBRUARY-TR   03-26 0098</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>HONG KONG FEBRUARY TRADE SWINGS INTO DEFICIT</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hong Kong recorded a 3.51 billion\\nH.K.

Money market sources said the market had begun\\nto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates\\nto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.\\n    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.\\n    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the\\nExchequer Nigel Lawson\\'s forecast of a 1987 current account\\ndeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.\\n    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in\\nFebruary to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.\\n    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.\\n    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and\\nDrew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would\\nprove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the\\nChancellor\\'s Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture\\non imported goods.\\n    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said\\nhis firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit\\nforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion\\nstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.\\n    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods\\nconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the\\nConfederation of British Industry.\\n    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if\\nJanuary\\'s bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas\\ngoods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,\\nHarwood said.\\n    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2\\npoint on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries\\nabout the figures evaporated.\\n    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling\\nto a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher\\nthan the European low of 1.5960.\\n    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market\\nsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.\\n    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was\\nlargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the\\nConservative government\\'s support was slipping.\\n    The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative\\nsupport had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the\\nAlliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31\\npct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,\\nwhose own support fell from 38 pct.\\n    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted\\nenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left\\nthe voters indifferent, political observers said.\\n    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn\\nthat today\\'s improved sentiment could be dented if support for\\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.\\n    This upsetting of the markets\\' political perceptions, which\\nare all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming\\ngeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,\\nHarwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial\\nrelief,\" he said.\\n    However, on the interest rate front, economists caution\\nthat Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by\\nencouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had\\nalready got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in\\nresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for\\nlower rates have been curtailed.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15370\" NEWID=\"9849\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 09:24:48.51</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>trade</D><D>crude</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>usa</D><D>south-korea</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;C G T M\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f0935&#31;reute\\nd f PM-KOREA-OIL   03-26 0137</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>S.

</DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank\\'s options for West\\nGermany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future\\nby the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and\\nemployers, economists and money market dealers said.\\n    Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to\\n3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct\\ntreasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.\\n    But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely\\nto encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for\\nfear of upsetting the current wage round.\\n    One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, \"I\\ndon\\'t think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever\\nhappens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it\\nwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\"\\n    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground\\nfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments\\nof growth and inflation, economists said.\\n    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the\\nBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,\\nraising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the\\nmedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.\\n    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move\\nthat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.\\n    In the current round, the country\\'s most powerful union,\\nthe IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is\\ndemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the\\npresent 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.\\n    The engineering employers\\' association, Gesamtmetall, is\\noffering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give\\na two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this\\nyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.\\n    The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe\\'s largest\\nunion, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the\\nbenchmark for settlements in other industries such as the\\npublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations\\nbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by\\nearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.\\n    Though many economists said the unions\\' current warning\\nstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and\\nwould not lead to a repeat of 1984\\'s damaging seven-week\\nstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on\\ntheir positions and there could still be conflict.\\n    This could extend the length of time in which the\\nBundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.\\n    The money market head said the unions\\' humiliation by the\\nprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative\\nhousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.\\n    \"The unions haven\\'t forgotten that and they will put this\\nsquarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said.\\n    In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall\\nunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than\\nhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle\\nto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.\\n    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in\\nsouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours\\nyesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and\\naerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.\\n    Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in\\nwarning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.\\n    Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates\\nwould rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on\\na politically-inhibited Bundesbank.\\n    About eight billion marks were coming into the market\\ntomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.\\n    As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank\\'s offer\\nto mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,\\nanticipating still lower rates before the month-end.\\n    But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers\\nwas due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of\\nliquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,\\nperhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.\\n    Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average\\n52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first\\n24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.\\n REUTER\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15496\" NEWID=\"9976\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 11:46:40.31</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>acq</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>japan</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f1567&#31;reute\\nh f BC-FOREIGN-FIRMS-HOPE-TO   03-26 0108</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>FOREIGN FIRMS HOPE TO JOIN JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Nobuo Ito of International\\nTelecom Japan Inc (ITJ), one of two rival firms seeking to\\nenter Japan\\'s international telecommunications market, said it\\nwill offer a stake in the company to 10 foreign firms.\\n      But he declined to specify what share the firms would\\ntake, and told Reuters they would not participate in its\\nmanagement.\\n    ITJ and International Digital Communications Planning Inc\\n(IDC), in which both Cable and Wireless Plc and Pacific Telesis\\nGroup own 20 pct stakes, are set to merge into a new entity to\\ncompete against Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"YES\" LEWISSPLIT=\"TRAIN\" CGISPLIT=\"TRAINING-SET\" OLDID=\"15497\" NEWID=\"9977\">\\n<DATE>26-MAR-1987 11:46:51.72</DATE>\\n<TOPICS><D>acq</D></TOPICS>\\n<PLACES><D>west-germany</D><D>usa</D></PLACES>\\n<PEOPLE></PEOPLE>\\n<ORGS></ORGS>\\n<EXCHANGES></EXCHANGES>\\n<COMPANIES></COMPANIES>\\n<UNKNOWN> \\n&#5;&#5;&#5;F\\n&#22;&#22;&#1;f1568&#31;reute\\nr f BC-SIEMENS-RAISES-STAKE   03-26 0101</UNKNOWN>\\n<TEXT>&#2;\\n<TITLE>SIEMENS RAISES STAKE IN TELECOM PLUS OF U.S.</TITLE>\\n<DATELINE>    MUNICH, West Germany, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Siemens AG\\'s &lt;SIEG.F>\\nfully-owned subsidiary Siemens Informations Systems Inc.

Gabbett</AUTHOR>\\n<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Less than two months after First\\nInterstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica\\nCorp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,\\nbut he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.\\n    In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he\\'s looking for\\nways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,\\n\"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our\\nindependence, if possible.\"\\n    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major\\nEast Coast banks to buy banks in California.\\n    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and\\nthe nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western\\nstates and has franchise operations in four additional states.\\n    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for\\nlarge U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the \\nlucrative California market and the West Coast region.\\n    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when\\nasked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,\\n\"That\\'s undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive\\nnot to think that.\"\\n    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as\\n\"opportunistic\".\\n    He said he will look for banks in management trouble that\\nhe can get at a bargain, then add management to restore\\nprofitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate\\nalready operates, then cut costs by combining resources.\\n    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most\\nof the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased\\nat a discount because of the depressed regional economy.\\n    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move\\nhim to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, \"We\\ncontinue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of\\npeople continue to monitor and look at us.\"\\n    Banking analysts, however, consider another First\\nInterstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen\\nany time soon.\\n    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25\\nbillion dlr bid at the nation\\'s second largest bank, \"a very,\\nvery difficult decision.\"\\n    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First\\nInterstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number\\nfour position in the California banking community.\\n    \"The competition in this state is tough,\" he said, noting\\nCityBank\\'s recent purchase of 50 financial service branches\\nfrom Sears Roebuck company. \"CityBank is moving rapidly to move\\nus down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,\" he said.\\n    Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security\\nPacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,\\nWashington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional\\ncompetitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.\\n    \"Security is, has been and continues to be a highly\\nprofitable and obviously well managed company,\" he said.\\n    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the\\nadvantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer\\nand has the recognition advantage of having given its regional\\nbanks a common name.\\n    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good\\nfinancial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain\\nserious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,\\nreal estate and agriculture dominate the economy.\\n    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,\\nhe said, \"I don\\'t think it has bottomed out, because I think\\nmost of the problems are real estate-related and the real\\nestate problems are going to be with us for several years.\"\\n    Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in\\nthe Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate\\'s\\nfranchise operation.\\n    First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First\\nInterstate financial services in ten states.\\n    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise\\noperation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because\\nmost of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into\\nthe Midwest must come first.\\n    Calling the franchise system, \"moderately profitable,\"\\nPinola said, \"It is going to take a rejuvenation of the\\nagriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed\\nwe were generating before the last year or two.\"\\n    On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks\\n1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks\\nwith minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.\\n Reuter\\n&#3;</BODY></TEXT>\\n</REUTERS>\\n<REUTERS TOPICS=\"NO\"
